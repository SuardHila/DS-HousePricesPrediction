This project focuses on predicting apartment prices in Mexico City using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that estimates apartment prices based on features such as area (size), location (latitude and longitude), and neighborhood (borough). 
The project includes several stages:

 * Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the real estate data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes and visualizes the relationships between the target variable (apartment price) and other features such as area, location, and neighborhood.
 * Modeling: Utilizes Ridge Regression—a regularized linear regression model—to predict apartment prices based on the provided features.
 * Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the Ridge Regression model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to ensure accuracy.
